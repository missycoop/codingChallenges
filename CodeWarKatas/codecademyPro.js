// Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name.
// Variables are stored in memory.
// The var keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
// let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned, and const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.
// Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined.
// Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
// The + operator is used to concatenate strings including string values held in variables
// In ES6, template literals use backticks ` and ${} to interpolate values into a string.
// The typeof keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.

//Conditionals
// An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
// if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
// We can add more conditions using else if statements.
// Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.
// The logical and operator, &&, or “and”, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.
// The logical operator ||, or “or”, checks if either provided expression is truthy.
// The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.
// The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.
// A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
